# QuickHeal
QuickHeal for Vanilla WoW 1.12. with integration for HealComm (Luna unit Frames).

I'm not the author of QuickHeal.

I just did the implementation for QuckHeal to use Healcom to heal smarter.
I also did some other additions and improvements.

I got the original version of QuickHeal from https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/project-2800.

# Installation
- Download QuickHeal from this repository into your Interface folder and remove the "-master" in the folder name
- Download HealComm or Luna unit Frames: https://github.com/Aviana/LunaUnitFrames
- Download Bonusscanner (Makes QhickHeal and HealComm (Luna unit Frames) more accurate by taking gear and +Heal into account: http://www.vanilla-addons.com/dls/bonusscanner/

# What this version of QuickHeal does:

**Integration of HealComm**
QuickHeal is now using the incomming heal information broadcasted by HealComm (Luna unit Frames) through the addonchannel to reduce overhealing and making this addon used by multible raidmembers more effective.
